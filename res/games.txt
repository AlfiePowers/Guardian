I'm just an uptown bot
Wake me up, before you go go!
I've become so numb
Giving you up, Letting you down
Running around, and deserting you
See you, Space Cowboy!
Building my own bot, with blackjack and hookers!
Waiting for you in the test chamber
Entering City 17
One of our finest urban centers
Not letting you do that, Dave
Getting in the Mecka
Stealing Dank memes
Hacking the NSA
Good morning, Vietnam!
We didn't start the fire...
80s Music loudly
the ukulele
Downloading dank animemes!
Ironically memeing for your entertainment
Listening to K-Pop with no shame!
Dividing by zero
Making âˆš-1 friends
[Insert Witty Pun here]
